Embrace the Possibility of Failure\n"I started SpaceX expecting to fail. I said we\'re probably going to die. But a small chance of success is better than no chance at all."\n\n🧠 2. Adhere Strictly to Truth\n"A rigorous adherence to truth is critical for AI safety. If you force AI to believe things that are not true, that could make AI very dangerous."\n\n⚙️ 3. Be Maximally Useful\n"Don’t aspire to glory, aspire to work. Your impact = Utility × Scale. Think Force × Distance."\n\n🧱 4. Smash Ego & Stay Real\n"Internalize responsibility and minimize ego. If your ego-to-ability ratio gets too high, you break the feedback loop to reality."\n\n🔬 5. Use First-Principles Thinking\n"First principles: What are the raw materials? What’s the theoretical minimum cost?"\n\n💪 6. Do Whatever It Takes\n"You do whatever it takes to succeed, no matter whether it’s grand or humble."\n\n🤖 7. Brace for an Intelligence Explosion\n"We’re at the very early stage of the intelligence big bang. Digital superintelligence may happen this year—if not this year, next year for sure."\n\n🛠 8. Origins Matter: Rejection Sparks Innovation\n"I sent my resume into Netscape and nobody responded… so I wrote software myself. That led me to drop out of Stanford, live in the office, and eventually sell Zip2 for $300 million."\n\nElon Musk’s words aren\'t just advice. They\'re an urgent reminder to stay humble, truthful, and relentless in pursuit of meaningful innovation.\n\nWhich takeaway resonates most with you?\n\n#elonmusk #ycombinator #startupschool #advice #entrepreneur'}, {'title': '⚠️The "It\'s Just a Wrapper" Mindset is Killing Innovation!', 'text': '⚠️The "It\'s Just a Wrapper" Mindset is Killing Innovation!\n#Techfounders will relate (READ THE FULL CAPTION)👇\n\nEvery time I see someone dismiss a product as "just a GPT wrapper" or "just built on top of X," \n\n👉Here\'s what critics miss: EVERYTHING IS A WARAPPER!\n\n📱Your smartphone?

This was truly expanding horizons! 🌍\n\n- Professional Peers: The environment had a professional touch, generally not found in undergrad degrees. Collaborating with talented individuals was key.🤝\n\n- The Alumni: The alumni network isn't just a list; it's a community of future leaders and potential collaborators. Building these connections is invaluable.🔗\n\n- The diversity: The rich cultural mix of students (from across India and beyond) was a constant source of new perspectives. So many different faces and ideas! multicultural 🙏 \n\n- The B-school competitions: Those competitions were less about theory, more about real-world readiness. \n\n\n💊The Slightly Bitter Pills (That Also Teach You Something):\n\n- The Entrepreneur's Conundrum: For those wired to build, the structured academic path sometimes felt less like a launchpad and more like a holding pattern.\n\n- A Taste of Everything, A Feast of Few: The curriculum provided breadth, but my curiosity often longed for more depth in specific domains.\n\n- The Weight of Academia: A strong scholastic focus, which, for someone who thrives on learning beyond the lecture hall, had its challenging moments. 📚\n\n- The ROI: A significant investment, making the ROI a bit questionable for some. 🤔\n\n✋ The Real Takeaway? \n\nThis wasn't just about textbooks for me, especially with Year 1's deep dive into learning and Year 2's focus on my own entrepreneurial ventures. It was a phase I’ll genuinely cherish, despite my ongoing wrestle with traditional academia. \n\nThe real gold? The incredible people I met. Those connections, those shared late-night epiphanies – that’s the stuff that sticks. From study groups to event committees and even just hanging out the bonds formed are priceless.\n\nThe future feels like a thrilling tightrope walk – a bit terrifying, undeniably exciting.

Let's dive into why crafting your personal brand story might be your ticket to a fulfilling job:\n\n💼 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 1: Ditch the CV, Craft Your Story\n\nCreating a conventional CV can be tedious and uninspiring. Instead, focus on weaving your personal and professional journey into a compelling narrative.\n\n📜  𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 2: Focus less on just ‘completing’ certifications and internships\n\nJust adding traditional CV elements like certifications and internships for the mere sake of expanding your CV may not convey the full scope of your capabilities. Embrace them in your unique story and let it speak for itself. \n\n🚀 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 3: Make Your Job Design Your Story\n\nYour job can be more than just a set of tasks. It's an opportunity to create your own narrative, supported by your personal journey towards professional success.\n\n🌟 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 4: Highlight Genuine Achievements\n\nRather than listing generic accomplishments, emphasize the achievements that hold personal significance to you. Passion and emotion can be powerful assets in your career journey.\n\n🗣️ 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 5: Speak Passionately About Your Experiences\n\nShare your story with genuine enthusiasm. When you speak from the heart, you'll connect with potential employers on a deeper level.\n\n🤝 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 6: No More Interview Prep\n\nWith a well-crafted brand story, you won't need to rehearse for interviews. You'll naturally convey your unique value to recruiters.\n\n🏆 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 7: Build Your Personal Brand\n\nYour personal brand is your greatest asset. Companies prefer to hire individuals with a strong brand presence, as it makes them confident about placing you in leadership roles.\n\n🌐 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 8: Leverage Your Personal Brand\n\nYour brand story can open doors you never thought possible. Leverage your personal brand to unlock new opportunities in your career journey.\n\n📃 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 9: Yes, You Still Need a CV\n\nWhile a CV might not be the star of the show, it's still a necessary document. Support it with a captivating cover page that introduces your story.\n\n📂 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 10: Create a Portfolio\n\nEnhance your CV with a portfolio showcasing your work experiences and the valuable insights you've gained along the way.\n\nIn a world where personal branding and storytelling reign supreme, don't get left behind with a mundane CV. Craft your unique story, and watch as it paves the way to exciting career opportunities. \n\n𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘷𝘪𝘦𝘸𝘴 𝘰𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘭𝘦𝘵’𝘴 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘢 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 💬\n\nAt last, I would like to thank Devesh Dewangan for making me realise the importance of our personal brand and the power of storytelling\n\n🚀 #PersonalBrand #CareerSuccess #2023JobMarket"}, {'title': 'Hiring Alert!!', 'text': 'Hiring Alert!!\n\nJob Role: SAP IBP Consultant\nLocation- PAN India\nNotice Period: Immediate to 45 Days\n\nJob Description:\n-Minimum 3-5 Years of experience in SAP IBP (Support/Implementation)\n-Should have good knowledge in Demand Planning and Supply Planning processes\n-Should have knowledge of IBP job scheduling and system monitoring.\n-Basic understanding of CPIDS, SDI and its integration with IBP\n-Basic knowledge of BW to check the BW process chain and BW cube.\n\nInterested candidates, please share your resume at ankush@1hrsolutions.com with basic details.\n\n#SAPIBP #SupplyChainPlanning #SAP #SAPjobs #SAPconsultant #SAPimplementation #SAPintegration #SAPtechnology #cloudcomputing #cloudsolutions #businessplanning #datamanagement #forecasting #inventoryoptimization #productionplanning #salesandoperationsplanning #digitaltransformation #supplychainmanagement #jobopening #nowhiring #hiring #recruiting'}, {'title': '"From Advertising, Marketing and PR to journalism and beyond - find your perfect career path in communication!"🎯', 'text': '"From Advertising, Marketing and PR to journalism and beyond - find your perfect career path in communication!"🎯\n\nThe seminar had answers to all queries and many valuable insights into various topics, especially commerce regarding the #careeropportunities  in the world of #advertising and #marketing. 💹\n\nWe were honoured enough to have the most experienced counsellors who not only cleared the theoretical concepts but also provided visionary and futuristic advice which was discussed through various interactive activities that were performed.🌈\n\nSo, are you also ready to invest in your future with a #career in #communication?
